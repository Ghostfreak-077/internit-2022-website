No one is aware of their true potential until they challenge their limits and try to surpass them. We at NIT, Silchar embolden students to pursue their athletic interests along with their academics. Being the Director of this institute, I happen to find myself in a  state of great awe and overwhelmed with pride for being a host to sports like Badminton, Chess, and Table Tennis for the Inter-NIT sports tournament. You are never really playing an opponent. You are playing yourself, your own highest standards, and when you reach your limits, that is a real joy. With that being said, I extend my warm wishes to all the participants and wish them luck.",

Being the Dean of Student Welfare of this college, it gives me immense joy to know that the inter-NIT sports meet for three sports, namely chess, badminton, and table tennis, is going to be held in our college. NIT, Silchar will be delighted to welcome the participants in this spectacular event to our campus. Everyone, including me, will be beyond excited to witness such thrilling competition among the players. Winning and losing is a part and parcel of life, but what matters most is what we learn from them. Best of luck to every player participating in this event!",
