# All India InterNIT Competitions 2022

A website built for displaying regular scores of the interNIT competitions held in the campus of NIT Silchar in Nov 2022. The scores are regularly updated, enabling the students to check the scores as soon as a match is over. The Website is built using MERN as a tech stack.

## Installation and Run

The project is hosted [here](https://aiinits22.netlify.app/) using a Netlify service for frontend, while the backend is hosted in Render.

For contributing to the project, one must run the repository locally. Firstly, we need to clone the repository to our local environment

```git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ghostfreak-077/internit-2022-website.git```

Once we cloned the repository along with its submodules, we need to setup the environment variables. The frontend contains the server url in 'Context.jsx', while in backend the '.env.example' is in config folder

### Using NPM

Next step is to install required dependencies using ```npm install``` in both frontend and backend directories respectively, and run using ```npm run start``` for frontend, while ```npm run dev``` for backend
